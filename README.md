## Game Rules

Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game where the goal is to uncover all the safe tiles without clicking on any mines. The numbers on the uncovered tiles indicate how many neighboring tiles have mines. Use this information to strategically deduce the location of mines and clear the board.

- Left-click on a tile to uncover it.
- Right-click (or long press on touch devices) to flag a tile suspected to have a mine.
- If you uncover a mine, the game ends immediately.
